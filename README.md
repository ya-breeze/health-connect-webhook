![HC Webhook](image.png)

An Android app that bridges Google Fit, Samsung Health, Fitbit, and other health apps to your webhooks or local tools via Health Connect APIs, enabling seamless integration with your custom endpoints, agents, and services.

## Overview

HC Webhook connects Google Health Connect to your webhook infrastructure and local automation tools. Health Connect aggregates health data from apps like Google Fit, Samsung Health, Fitbit, and more into a unified API. This app reads that aggregated data and sends it to your configured webhook URLs on your chosen sync strategy (interval-based or scheduled times), or exposes realtime JSON through an optional local HTTP server for devices and tools on your network.

## How It Works

1. **Health Apps** (Google Fit, Samsung Health, Fitbit, etc.) sync data to **Health Connect**
2. **Health Connect** aggregates all health data into a unified API
3. **HC Webhook** reads data from Health Connect using your selected sync mode (interval or scheduled), manual sync, or local HTTP request
4. **HC Webhook** sends the data to your configured **webhook URLs** and can optionally serve realtime JSON over your local network
5. Your **custom services, local agents, or automation tools** receive and process the health data

## Supported Health Apps

Health Connect aggregates data from these popular health and fitness apps:

- **Google Fit** - Activity tracking, workouts, and health metrics
- **Samsung Health** - Comprehensive health and fitness tracking
- **Fitbit** - Activity, sleep, and heart rate data
- **MyFitnessPal** - Nutrition and calorie tracking
- **Strava** - Running and cycling activities
- **Nike Run Club** - Running activities and workouts
- **Withings** - Weight, blood pressure, and activity tracking
- **Garmin Connect** - Fitness and health data from Garmin devices
- **Polar** - Heart rate and fitness tracking
- **Oura** - Sleep, activity, and recovery data
- **And many more...** - Any app that syncs to Health Connect

> **Note**: You don't need to install all these apps. Just ensure the apps you use are syncing their data to Health Connect, and HC Webhook will automatically access that unified data.

## API reference

Integrations and automations can rely on these specs (kept in sync with the app code):

- **[Webhook payload](docs/webhook.md)** — `POST` JSON body: root fields, every data-type array, incremental sync vs explicit ranges, units, and examples.
- **[Local HTTP server](docs/local-http.md)** — `GET` endpoints (`/`, `/latest`, `/ping`), query parameters, listen binding, default port **8787**, and how pull-based reads differ from webhook sync.

## Supported Languages

The app is fully localized and supports 10 languages. You can manually override the app language from the **About** screen:

- 🇬🇧 English (Default)
- 🇮🇳 Tamil
- 🇫🇷 French
- 🇩🇪 German
- 🇪🇸 Spanish
- 🇵🇹 Portuguese
- 🇨🇳 Chinese (Simplified)
- 🇯🇵 Japanese
- 🇰🇷 Korean
- 🇮🇹 Italian

### Building the APK

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The APK will be generated at: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

## Usage

### Initial Setup

1. **Install Health Connect** (if not already installed)
   - Download from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.healthdata)

2. **Grant Permissions**
   - Open the app and tap "Grant Permissions"
   - Select the health data types you want to sync
   - Grant the required permissions in Health Connect

3. **Configure Webhooks**
   - Add one or more webhook URLs (must start with `http://` or `https://`)
   - Select which data types to sync
   - Choose sync mode:
     - **Interval Mode**: set your preferred sync interval (minimum 15 minutes)
     - **Scheduled Mode**: configure one or more fixed times of day
   - Optionally enable **Local HTTP Server** and choose a port for local network access

4. **Save Configuration**
   - Tap "Save Configuration" to start automatic syncing

### Manual Sync

- Tap the "Sync Now" button in the Manual Sync section to immediately sync all enabled data types to your webhooks

### Viewing Logs

- Access webhook logs from the menu (⋮) → "Webhook Log"
- View detailed information about each webhook request, including timestamps, status codes, and response data

### Local HTTP Server

Enable the local HTTP server from the configuration screen to expose Health Connect JSON to tools on the same network. The app keeps the server active through a **foreground service** while the feature is enabled. Only **GET** is supported; there is no authentication—use on a trusted LAN.

Quick endpoint map (details in **[docs/local-http.md](docs/local-http.md)**):

- `http://<device-ip>:<port>/` — On-demand read from Health Connect (default **48-hour** window; optional `?days=N` for **N** full days).
- `http://<device-ip>:<port>/latest` — Last published JSON from a successful `GET /` or webhook sync, or `{"status":"no_data"}`.
- `http://<device-ip>:<port>/ping` — `{"status":"ok"}` health check.

Default port is **8787** (configurable **1024–65535**). Example: `http://192.168.1.25:8787/`.

> **Note**: Local HTTP access depends on Android background execution, Wi-Fi availability, and device battery optimization settings. For best reliability, keep the phone awake/charging or exclude HC Webhook from aggressive battery optimization on devices that restrict foreground services.

### Providing Feedback

- Open the **About** tab and tap **Provide Feedback**
- Submit bugs, feature ideas, or general suggestions in the bottom sheet
- Your past submissions are saved on-device and shown in the sheet
- Tap **View all feature requests** to browse the public board at [hc-webhook.feedbackjar.com](https://hc-webhook.feedbackjar.com/)
- Submissions include device metadata (app version, Android version, screen size, locale) plus the build flavor (`foss` or `playstore`)

## Configuration

### Sync Interval

- **Interval Mode** (WorkManager)
  - Minimum: 15 minutes
  - Recommended: 30-60 minutes for most use cases
- **Scheduled Mode** (AlarmManager)
  - Sync at specific times of day (default: Morning 08:00 and Evening 21:00)
  - Add, remove, and toggle individual schedule entries
  - Uses exact alarms when available (Android 12+ permission dependent), with safe fallback

### Webhook format

Delivery is **`POST`** with **`Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8`**. The body is one JSON object: always **`timestamp`** (when the payload was built) and **`app_version`**, plus optional **snake_case** arrays per data type (each key omitted if there are no records in that batch). Background sync reads a rolling **48-hour** window and, by default, only records **new since the last successful sync** per type (first run has no prior watermark). If the gap since the last successful scheduled sync exceeds 48 hours, the missed period is replayed automatically in bounded slices, up to 30 days back, before the app returns to its normal 48-hour window.

Full field tables, units, nutrition/skin-temperature notes, and examples: **[docs/webhook.md](docs/webhook.md)**.

> **Note**: Webhook delivery includes short retry handling (up to 3 attempts with exponential backoff). If delivery still fails, data is retried on the next successful sync trigger (manual, interval, or scheduled).

The local server returns the **same JSON schema** via **`GET`**; semantics (incremental webhook vs on-demand full-window `GET /`) are described in **[docs/local-http.md](docs/local-http.md)**.

### Data Privacy

- All health data remains on your device until explicitly sent to your configured webhooks
- The app only reads data that you explicitly grant permission for
- No data is sent to third-party services except your configured webhooks
- If the local HTTP server is enabled, devices on the same local network can request the exposed JSON endpoint
- You can revoke permissions at any time through Android settings

## Known Limitations

- ⚠️ **Offline Handling** - The app attempts to retry failed webhook requests briefly (3 retries). If the internet is unavailable, the sync fails safely and data is retried on the next successful sync trigger (manual, interval, or scheduled).
- 🕒 **48-Hour Lookback** - To ensure performance and relevance, the app scans for health data within a rolling 48-hour window. This applies to manual sync and the local HTTP server. Scheduled/interval sync additionally catches up automatically: if it detects a gap since the last successful sync longer than 48 hours (e.g. the phone was off the home network for several days), it replays the missed period from that point forward in bounded slices, up to 30 days back.
- 🔋 **Local Server Reliability** - The local HTTP server runs as a foreground service, but availability can still be affected by Doze mode, Wi-Fi sleep, and aggressive OEM battery optimization.
