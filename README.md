# Health Connect to Webhook

An Android app that forwards health data from Google Fit, Samsung Health, Fitbit,
and other apps to your webhooks or local tools via Health Connect.

## How it works

1. Your health apps sync to **Health Connect**, which aggregates them into one API.
2. **HC Webhook** reads that data on an interval, on a schedule, or on demand.
3. It `POST`s the data to your webhook URLs (JSON or Protobuf/gRPC) and can serve
   realtime JSON over your local network.
4. Your services, agents, or automation tools receive it.

## Features

Interval or scheduled sync · 31 health data types · multiple webhooks · JSON or
Protobuf/gRPC delivery · local HTTP server · webhook logs · settings
backup/restore · 10 languages. Full list, supported apps, and data types:
**[docs/features.md](docs/features.md)**.

Interval and scheduled syncs keep dedicated last-successful automatic progress.
After a gap longer than the normal 48-hour window, they replay missed delivery
in 24-hour slices (up to 30 days). Manual sync and local API activity can update
the displayed last-sync status, but never move this automatic catch-up cursor.
