# Webhook payload reference

HC Webhook delivers health data as a **single JSON object** in the HTTP request body. The same structure is used for **remote webhooks** (POST) and for responses from the **optional local HTTP server** (GET), so one schema covers both.

Implementation: `buildJsonPayload` in `app/src/main/java/com/hcwebhook/app/SyncManager.kt`.

## HTTP request (remote webhooks)

| Property | Value |
|----------|--------|
| Method | `POST` |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json; charset=utf-8` |
| Body | UTF-8 JSON object (see below) |

The app may attach **custom headers** per webhook URL as configured in the app. There is no built-in signature or auth header unless you add it there.

Successful delivery is any HTTP **2xx** response. Failed requests are retried briefly (a few attempts with backoff); if all attempts fail, the next manual, interval, or scheduled sync can try again with the same incremental rules.

## Root JSON object

| Field | Type | Always present | Description |
|-------|------|----------------|-------------|
| `timestamp` | string | yes | ISO-8601 instant when the payload was built (`Instant.now()`), not the time range of the health records. |
| `app_version` | string | yes | Human-readable app version name from the running build. |
| All other keys | array | no | One array per enabled data type that has **at least one** record in this payload. Omitted keys mean “no records in this batch” for that type—not “disabled in settings.” |

Arrays are **never** empty: if a type has no data for this sync, the key is omitted entirely.

### Time fields

Unless noted otherwise, time-valued fields use **`java.time.Instant.toString()`** (ISO-8601 UTC with `Z`, e.g. `2026-05-09T12:34:56.789Z`).

### Which records appear (incremental vs full window)

- **Background / manual sync (default)**  
  Reads within a rolling **48-hour** window (`HealthConnectManager`) and, for each enabled type, applies the **last successful sync instant** for that type so only **new or updated** records (relative to that watermark) are included. First sync has no watermark, so everything in the window can appear.

- **Explicit range** (e.g. local HTTP `?days=7` or a chosen start/end)  
  Uses the requested window and **does not** apply last-sync filtering; the payload can contain all records in that range for enabled types.

- **Scheduled/interval catch-up** (gap since the last successful sync exceeds 48 hours)  
  Also an explicit range internally: the missed period is split into 24-hour slices and each slice is delivered as its own full-window payload, oldest first, until the gap is closed (clamped to 30 days back). The app then returns to the normal 48-hour incremental window.

Only types the user enabled **and** granted Health Connect permission for are read; others simply produce no arrays.

## Example (illustrative only)

Shape varies with your enabled types and data:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-05-09T14:00:00.123Z",
  "app_version": "1.2.3",
  "steps": [
    {
      "count": 8421,
      "start_time": "2026-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "end_time": "2026-05-09T00:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "heart_rate": [
    { "bpm": 72, "time": "2026-05-09T08:15:00Z" }
  ]
}
```

## Local HTTP server

The optional on-device server uses the **same JSON** as webhooks but over **GET** on your LAN. Endpoints, query parameters, binding, and how `/` differs from incremental webhook sync are documented in **[local-http.md](./local-http.md)**.

## Schema stability

Field names and units are defined by the app version that produced the payload (`app_version`). When upgrading integrations, compare `app_version` or pin your parser to documented keys above; new Health Connect types or fields may be added in future releases.
